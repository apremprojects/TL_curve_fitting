What is thermoluminescence?



* Ionizing radiation excites and traps electrons into higher energy levels (E).
* Heat provides necessary activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>) for electrons to fall back to their ground state
* Electron passes through luminescence center
* Excess energy is emitted as light (hv), which is measurable (= glow curve)
* Type of trap trap present and its stability is governed by the electron trap (E, in eV) and the Arrhenius factor (s, in s<sup>-1</sup>)

What is thermoluminescence? (cont.)



* The light emission from TL can be described with the following equation for each peak, where n<sub>0</sub> is the amount of filled traps, N is the number of total traps available, and β is the heating rate.
